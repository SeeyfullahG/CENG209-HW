How to Play the Dungeon Survival Game
This game is a text-based adventure where you try to survive in the mysterious rooms of a dungeon. The goal is to defeat all the monsters and clear the dungeon. When the game starts, your character begins in a randomly chosen room with initial stats (health, strength, inventory). You can use the following commands to explore the dungeon:

oda_bak (look around): Provides a description of your current room, including any items present and whether there’s a monster.
git <room number> (move): Moves you between rooms. For example, "git 2" will take you to Room-2.
envanter (inventory): Shows the items you are carrying and their effects. For instance, a "Sword" increases your attack power, while "Armor" boosts both your attack power and health.
al <item> (take): Allows you to pick up items in the room. The item is added to your inventory, and its effects are applied to your stats.
saldir (attack): Attacks a monster in the room. During combat, you deal damage to the monster but may also take damage in return.
kaydet (save) and yukle (load): Save your progress or load a previously saved game to continue from where you left off.
cikis (exit): Exits the game.
The game requires strategic planning: collect items wisely, attack at the right moment, and avoid taking unnecessary damage. If your health drops to zero, you’ll respawn in a random room. Once you defeat all monsters, you conquer the dungeon and win the game. Gather your courage and dive into the dark world of the dungeon!
